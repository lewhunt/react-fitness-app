In the app the user can choose an exercise type and duration. It then starts playback of the exercise routine and proceeds to loop through a configurable amount of exercise reps.

For more information about the react-video-looper component (and how to use it) [see the repo here](https://github.com/lewhunt/react-video-looper).
